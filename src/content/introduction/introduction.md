S'more contains a set of miscellaneous Web Components. Based on browser-standard features, S'more components can be used in any framework and in addition to any set of UI components.

## Quickstart 
Include the following tag in any `.html` file or read about [other installation options](/docs/installation).
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@smore/core/dist/smore.js"> </script>
```

## About
S'more components are reusable utilities. They aren't concerned with how things look, so every component can be styled to your liking. The goal of S'more is to reduce the amount of hand-rolled solutions or bloated libraries that power common interactions all over the web.

S'more components are modular, tiny, and performant.

I hope you like 'em.
